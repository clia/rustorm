# TODO
- [ ] Implement the table_info extraction for mysql.
- [ ] building the SQL statement should return the sql as string and the arg_value separately
    - this is an easy way to mitigate SQL injection

- [X] **breaking** Rename Table to TableDef and Column to ColumnDef, it is a more appropriate name
- [ ] Support for transactions
